authorise_the_sociedad_popular_restauradora_desc;Our fellow Argentines long for a great national constitution and have been calling on us to convene the provincial delegates.\n\nNo one is more persuaded than we are of the necessity of organising a national government. But let us consider the state of the Republic today and the turbulent condition of the provinces: all of them are contaminated by Unitarists, by political strategists, by aspiring officeholders, by secret agents of other nations, and by the Freemasons who have all of Europe in a frenzy.\n\nIt would be foolish to believe that the solution is to rush in and call for a constitutional congress. We shall first carefully guide the people and allow time for the seeds of discord to self-destruct. Our loyal patriots of the Sociedad Popular Restauradora will see to it.\n\n\n§YPolitical campaigns are more effective if certain rights are curtailed:\n\nPolitical Parties set to §ROnly Underground§Y or §RHarassment§Y.\nPublic Meetings set to §RMeetings Not Allowed§Y.\nPress Rights set to §RState Press Only§Y.\n\nCampaign events are §G1.44, 2, or 3 times more frequent§Y depending on the number of requirements satisfied.§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

begin_federalist_efforts_desc;The Federal Pact of 1831 which established the Argentine Confederation provided for the convening of a General Federative Congress as soon as all the sister provinces are enjoying full freedom and tranquility. It is this congress which would be tasked with the writing of a constitution for our Republic.\n\nGeneral Rosas has been delaying the political process for too long, claiming that the country is disorderly. It is the will of our people to resume the great work of national organisation no matter what, to settle questions of administration, trade, sovereignty, and decide which institutions befit Argentina. We will pave the way to a federal republic.\n\n\n§YConservative pops have §G5% Soldier Encouragement§Y while Federalist efforts are ongoing.\n\nPolitical campaigns are more effective if certain rights are curtailed:\n\nPolitical Parties set to §ROnly Underground§Y or §RHarassment§Y.\nPublic Meetings set to §RMeetings Not Allowed§Y.\nPress Rights set to §RState Press Only§Y.\n\nCampaign events are §G1.44, 2, or 3 times more frequent§Y depending on the number of requirements satisfied.§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
begin_unitarian_efforts_title;Begin Unitarian Efforts;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
begin_unitarian_efforts_desc;The bloodthirsty tyrant Rosas and the barbarian caudillos in his employ hold the Republic in the grip of terror. They claim to be federalists but the truth is plain: all they ever do is tear the entrails of our noble people and hold it in slavery. Instead all Argentines should desire for a union in civilisation and in liberty.\n\nWe must gather strength and allies before we oust the so-called Restorer and put an end to Rosismo. Only then will we be able to build a modern Argentina.\n\n\n§YLiberal pops have §G10% Soldier Encouragement§Y while Unitarian efforts are ongoing.\n\nPolitical campaigns are more effective if certain rights are curtailed:\n\nPolitical Parties set to §ROnly Underground§Y or §RHarassment§Y.\nPublic Meetings set to §RMeetings Not Allowed§Y.\nPress Rights set to §RState Press Only§Y.\n\nCampaign events are §G1.44, 2, or 3 times more frequent§Y depending on the number of requirements satisfied.§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

nationalise_the_buenos_aires_customs_desc;Owing to its monopoly position on foreign trade, the duties that the Buenos Aires Customs levy are paid by all the Argentine provinces. It is only because the bloodthirsty tyrant Rosas allowed it that this income has benefited the Porteño elite only. Their interests should not come before those of Argentina and if we are to become a modern country this revenue should be nationalised.\n\n\n§YEnd the following customs monopoly effects in the province of Buenos Aires:\n§GCattle farming efficiency: +25%\nRuling party support: +50%§Y\n\nEnd the following customs monopoly effects in other Platine provinces:\n§RCattle Farming Efficiency: -15%\nLocal Consciousness: +0.05§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

grant_the_buenos_aires_customs_monopoly_desc;The Buenos Aires Customs is an institution dating back from the early days of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. Under the successive rules that have since then come, it has enjoyed various privileges but none so important as its monopoly on foreign trade. By restoring this right and vesting it into the Porteño elite we shall finally bring an end to contraband and stop the devastating effects of foreign imports on our economy.\n\n\n§YCustoms monopoly effects in the province of Buenos Aires:\n§GCattle farming efficiency: +25%\nRuling party support: +50%§Y\n\nCustoms monopoly effects in other Platine provinces:\n§RCattle Farming Efficiency: -15%\nLocal Consciousness: +0.05§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
### Events ###;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME252000;Rosista Terror in $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC252000;Under the supervision of the followers of the one they call the ‘Supreme Chief’, efforts have accrued in $COUNTRY$ to boost support for the ruling party. Intellectuals praise the national cause while political badges and patriotic song books are handed out to the citizenry. In church the priests exhort their parishioners to defend the Holy Cause of the Federation.\n\nChillingly the Rosistas have also undertaken strong political measures and a climate of fear is spreading. Reports have been coming in that dissenting newspapers have been stifled, judges have been removed from their position, and political clubs and their members have been the targets of intimidation and harassment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC252001;The Federalists in $COUNTRY$ are emboldened and are rallying support for their cause both internally and abroad. Calls for national organisation have been appearing in sympathetic newspapers and are on display on everybody's lapel.\n\nThe order of the day is that no more delay should be tolerated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC252002;The Unitarians in $COUNTRY$ are emboldened and are rallying support for their cause both internally and abroad. The names of the victims of Rosas and his lackeys are displayed in the newspapers while the sky blue flags are flown on the buildings and during parades.\n\nNow that the yoke of Rosismo is lifted the political classes are lively with discussion. With the end of the old regime a possibility, what shall take its place?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME252010;Letter from Concerned Citizens;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC252010;To the Restorer of the Laws from your friends at the Sociedad Popular Restauradora, $PROVINCENAME$ chapter. We must report troubling developments: people have been holding political meetings, firebrands disseminate obscene pamphlets in the city streets, and conspiratorial whispers can be heard in the pews after Mass. Worst of all, young men have been seen walking about with their breast bare of the bright poppy badge that all good Federalists wear.\n\nThere is no mistaking it: the stench of the savage Unitarian is in the air. Not just in $PROVINCENAME$, but all throughout $STATENAME$. We fellow patriots ask what should be done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA252010;We must organise. Hold a meeting of the Restorers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
