### Events ###;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME250000;Argentine Civil Wars;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC250000;Under the dictatorial rule of Juan Manuel de Rosas, the caudillos, military leaders, of outlying provinces of Argentina were frequently at war with one another or in rebellion against the Argentine Confederation. This was agitated by oppressive economic policies in Buenos Aires, the only deep water port in Argentina. Heavy trade duties placed on incoming cargo inspired strong feelings against the 'porteños' or port-city dwellers. However, some respected Rosas himself due to his military successes and strong rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA250000;These uprisings will be put down!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME250010;Brazil responds;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC250010;Brazil has responded favorably to our request for aid against the tyranny of Rosas, sending much-needed artillery and troops!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA250010;Rosas will fall!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME250011;Uruguay responds;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC250011;The Colorados, Uruguay's liberal party, have joined our cause against Rosas. This comes as no surprise, given his persistent aid of their enemies, the Blancos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA250011;Rosas will fall!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME250012;Corrientes responds;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC250012;Corrientes has responded favorably to our request to join us in uprising against the tyranny of Rosas!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA250012;Rosas will fall!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME250020;The secession of Buenos Aires;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC250020;General Urquiza's victory dealt  a serious blow to the hopes of unitarians. Urquiza sought a federalist Argentina with increased power for individual states, while predominantly upper class liberal unitarians in Buenos Aires supported increased power for their own city. They furthermore feared that Urquiza would become a dictator little different from Juan Manuel de Rosas. Unitarians in Buenos Aires led a tense but peaceful revolution during a temporary absence of Urquiza from the city. The State of Buenos Aires therefore seceded, although this was not recognized by other nations. There was talk of making the secession permanent, instituting the Republic of the Rio de La Plata, but prominent leaders wished to leverage the federalists into agreeing to a united Argentina with strong centralized rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA250020;Damn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME250030;Rejoining the Argentine Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC250030;Now that the Platine War has concluded, we may ask them to rejoin the Confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA250030;We welcome Corrientes back!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB250030;They are not welcome here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME250040;The Corrientes Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC250041;We have been asked to rejoin the Argentine Confederation now that the Platine War has finished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA250041;Long live the Argentine Confederation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME250043;The Corrientes Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA250043;This betrayal will not be forgotten!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME250050;Entre Rios rejoins the Argentine Confederation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC250050;Now that we have won the Platine War, Entre Rios has become an integral part of the Urquiza-led Argentine Confederation, with its new capital in Paraná.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA250050;Long live the Argentine Confederation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME250060;Negotiations with the Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC250060;Our country has been torn for too long. There's even talk by some porteños that we should make our independence official and become forever separated from the Confederation.\n\nPresident Urquiza of the Argentine Confederation approached the government of Buenos Aires and offers to reunite the country by making some amendments in the constitution to benefit us, but the porteños aren't happy with only these and threaten to become rebellious in case we accept Urquiza's offer. On the other hand, Urquiza and the Confederation threaten to force us to accept the new constitution in case this secession goes on for too long.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA250060;We will have the country united OUR way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB250060;We do not accept the constitution, but will not take action right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC250060;Accept the offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME250061;The Argentine Civil War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC250061;The porteños in Buenos Aires have finally attacked us to force their disastrous liberal views upon our nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA250061;To arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME250062;Buenos Aires stands down;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC250062;The porteños in Buenos Aires finally acknowledged good sense and have agreed to abide by our perfectly reasonable Constitution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA250062;We welcome them back!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME250080;A federalist Argentine Republic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC250080;Finally, the federalists stand triumphant over the unitarians! Buenos Aires has no choice but to grant rightfully deserved power to the provinces. A united federalist Argentina is now within our grasp!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA250080;Long live Argentina!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB250080;There is no need to proclaim a republic. Long live the Argentine Confederation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME250090;Argentina has formed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC250090;Now that Argentina has formed we should decide if we wish to join them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA250104;We must forge our own path...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME250110;Increasing opposition from all sides;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC250110;Liberal sentiment has been increasing in Buenos Aires, even though circumstances have not been right for granting voting rights to the people. We have also gained some powerful enemies in attempting to exert control over northern provinces that are rightfully ours. There are rumors of a Northern Coalition forming against us, and increasingly dangerous traitors are in our midst. Matters are so serious that President Juan Manuel de Rosas is increasingly afraid to leave his home for fear of assassins. Perhaps it is time to grant controlled voting rights to the unprepared people of the Confederation, before our enemies force the matter through bloodshed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA250110;The people would only harm themselves with democracy at this time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB250110;If democracy is necessary to preserve the Confederation, so be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME250120;The Argentine Confederation submits;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC250120;Rosas has voluntarily left office rather than fight a losing war against us. He has gone into exile overseas in the United Kingdom. The Argentine Confederation government will temporarily be in the hands of General Urquiza until a new constitution can be drafted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA250120;Let the Constitution be drafted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME250130;Argentina has formed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC250130;The provinces of the Argentine Confederation have enjoyed limited self rule for decades. Now that Argentina has been formed, we must decide whether we wish to acknowledge its existence and join as member states.

EVTOPTA250130;Yes, we wish to join.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB250130;No, we will not join them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME250131;The Argentine Confederation has asked to join us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA250140;Viva Argentina!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB250140;No, it would be unwise to make this change.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME250150;The Rebellion of 1880;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC250150;Federalization of Buenos Aires as the official capital of our country, separate from Buenos Aires province, has been a point of conflict for decades. The porteños wish to exercise complete control over the surrounding area, but outlying provinces prefer a federalized separate national capital. The liberal candidate Carlos Tejedor has lost a campaign for the presidency on an anti-federalization platform. In response, he has led an armed rebellion against our country!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA250150;Force them to submit!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB250150;We do not want federalization that badly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME250160;Buenos Aires Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC250160;Tejedor and the porteños have enforced their demands, and federalism cannot be the law of the land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA250160;Damn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME250170;Buenos Aires Defeat;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC250170;We have put down the porteño rebellion, and now Buenos Aires will be enforced in the Constitution as the official federalized capital! This victory consolidates Buenos Aires as an integral part of our country without unfair advantages over outlying provinces!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA250170;I hope they have learned their lesson!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME250180;The Argentine Centennial!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC250180;This year we celebrate 100 years of freedom from colonial rule! After many long and bloody struggles, Argentina has solidified its place as a nation, and is no longer a collection of warring provinces with separate national identities. Our substates have the option of joining us, and we are sure that they will accept.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA250180;Viva Argentina!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME250190;Treaty of Friendship, Trade and Navigation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC250190;A few years after the Battle of Caseros, the Argentine Confederation agreed to a treaty to promote trade with Brazil along the La Plata River.

EVTDESC250196;A few years after the Battle of Caseros, the Argentine Confederation and Chile agreed to a treaty to establish borders of the two nations based on what they possessed before their wars of independence from Spain.
