Community Curated HFM
---------------------

[Obtain the latest pre-release here.][RELEASE]

[RELEASE]: https://github.com/moretrim/ccHFM/releases/

An unauthorised, unaffiliated effort to maintain the [Historical Flavour Mod][HFM] for Victoria II.
HFM development was [discontinued in 2020][discontinued], but this ambitious overhaul mod keeps a
special place in our hearts.

The main objective of this project is to **preserve the HFM experience** and we are mainly
interested in doing the following:

- identify and correct shortcomings of HFM
- whenever it makes sense, submit these fixes and other issues to parent mod [HPM]

[HPM]: https://github.com/arkhometha/Historical-Project-Mod

We also have a view on advancing from 1.27I (the latest stable release) as a basis, to the
unfinished 1.28 branch when development was halted. However this involves catching-up to version
0.4.5 of parent mod HPM (from 2019) that itself performed a big leap from previous major version
0.3, undergoing some growing pains. Preliminary experience suggests that this is easier said than
done, and fixing bugs will remain priority #1.

Features
--------

Due to our focus on bug fixes we produce many small changes. We organise them in two ways according
to your needs:

 * [**Chronological version history**][changelog], with a special highlight for flagship changes for
   each release
 * [**Breakdown of changes organised by game feature**][features]

[The history of editorial changes is collected separately.][editorial]
