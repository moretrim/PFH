Editorial Changes
=================

Policy
------

Editorial changes are submitted upstream to [HPM] whenever applicable.

Since they can often clash with other kinds of PRs, and since the development of [HFM] is presently
on indefinite hiatus we however do not submit purely editorial changes there. We do track these
changes in the [editorial-changes] branch of this repo. This makes it easy to roll out patches as
required, or even submit PRs should development resume.
